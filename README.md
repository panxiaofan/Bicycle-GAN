# Bicycle-GAN

## Dependency

* python 3.8
* pytorch 1.7.0
* ..(see requirements.txt)

## File Structure
* requirements.txt
* src (set src folder as source root)
  - datasets.py
  - inference.py
  - models.py
  - train.py

* data
  - train
  - val

* checkpoint (this can be automatically generated after running train.py)
  - bicyclegan_0_999.pt
  - bicyclegan_1_1999.pt
  - ...
  - bicyclegan_18_18999.pt
  - bicyclegan_19_19999.pt

## Usage

train
```
python train.py
```
inference
(make sure there are checkpoint .pt files in the checkpoint folder named as bicyclegan_x_x999.pt) where x refers to the number of epoch)
```
python inference.py
```
After running inference.py, a folder named inference will be generated. 
* inference
  - eval_checkpoints (ten image outputs generated by each checkpoint saved at each epoch)
  - fake_images (all fake images from validation dataset, used for FID evaluation)
  - real_images (all real images from validation dataset, used for FID evaluation)
  - results (image outputs generated by the best performing checkpoint)
